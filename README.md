# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) - Formative 1

## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and visualization. The notebook `PCA_formative.ipynb` contains data preprocessing, variance explanation, PCA transformation, and visualization of results.

## Features
- **Data Handling:** Identifies and processes non-numeric data using encoding and imputation techniques.
- **Explained Variance Calculation:** Computes eigenvalues, sorts them in descending order, and selects principal components based on explained variance.
- **Visualization:** Plots data before and after PCA transformation with correctly labeled axes.
- **Manual Calculation:** Includes eigenvector calculations and an explanation of PCAâ€™s effects.

## Files
- `PCA_formative.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook implementing PCA step by step.
- `fuel_econ.csv` - Dataset.
-  `README.md` - Project documentation.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Running the Notebook
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook PCA_formative.ipynb
```
2. Execute the cells step by step to see PCA in action.

## Results
- Displays variance contribution of each principal component.
- Transformed dataset with reduced dimensions.
- Graphical comparison before and after PCA application.
